## Won't this drastically increase my bundle size for libraries I don't need?

Yes, it will. `golgoth` is not meant to be used for browser code.

## I could manually add the modules I want when I want them, what's the  point?

I see `golgoth` as a protyping tool. I install it to quickly have access to
everything I need. So far the ease of development outweight the cons for me.
