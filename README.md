# Î© Golgoth

Meta-package including all the libs I always need (lodash, pify, etc)

When building project in JavaScript, I often end up installing the same
dependencies over and over again. This meta-package is a prototyping shortcut
for me, to install them all in one go.

## Libraries included

- `chalk`: Pretty colors in terminal output
- `dayjs`: Easy date parsing and comparing
- `firost`: Own filesystem helper functions
- `lodash`: JavaScript utility belt
- `pAll`, `pMap` and `pMapSeries`: Iterate over `async` methods
- `pify`: Convert those pesky callbacks into Promises
- `query-string`: Parse query strings

## Usage

Use the flavor your prefer:

```javascript
// Load everything and then use what you need
import golgoth from 'golgoth';
golgoth.pify();

// import only what you need
import { pAll, pMap } from 'golgoth';
```

## Notes

`lodash` is available either as `lodash` or `_`.
